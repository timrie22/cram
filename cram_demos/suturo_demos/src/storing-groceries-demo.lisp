;;max-objects dictates how many times the main loop from the table to the shelf should be performed.
;;open-shelf dictates if the shelf door should be opened. open-shelf = 0 -> skip door, open-shelf > 0 -> open door.
;;skip-shelf-perception dictates if the contents of the shelf should be perceived. Useful for testing. skip-shelf-perception = T -> skip perception of shelf contents, skip-shelf-perception = NIL -> perceive shelf contents.
;;joint-angle: Dictates how far the door will be opened, this value MUST ALWAYS be positive.
;;WARNING: JOINT ANGLE MUST BE POSITIVE FLOAT!
;;collision-mode: Different options, most common is :allow-all or :avoid-all
