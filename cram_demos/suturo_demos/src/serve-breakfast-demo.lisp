;; LUCA TODO
;; rewrite~/SUTURO/SUTURO_WSS/planning_ws/src/cram/cram_external_interfaces/cram_giskard/src/collision-scene.lisp to function without using the bulletworld as reasoning tool, but rather use knowledge as reasoning tool. For example "update-object-pose-in-collision-scene"

;; Rewrite or duplicate and change the following functions (in order to preserve the original implementation in case its vital to other plans):
;; make-giskard-environment-request, uses btr in on the very bottom

;; reset-collision-scene

;; update-object-pose-in-collision-scene

;; add-object-to-collision-scene

;; detach-object-in-collision-scene

;; attach-object-to-arm-in-collision-scene

;; full-update-collision-scene
